# JavaScript Array Basics Exercises

## Exercise 1: Adding and Removing Elements

1. Create an array called `fruits` and initialize it with three fruit names of your choice.
2. Add a new fruit to the end of the array using the `push` method.
3. Remove the last element from the array using the `pop` method.
4. Add a new fruit to the beginning of the array using the `unshift` method.
5. Remove the first element from the array using the `shift` method.
6. Print the final state of the `fruits` array to the console.

## Exercise 2: Accessing and Modifying Elements

1. Create an array called `numbers` with the values `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`.
2. Access the first and last elements of the array and print them to the console.
3. Change the value of the second element to `25`.
4. Print the modified array to the console.

## Exercise 3: Checking the Length of an Array

1. Create an array called `colors` with at least five color names.
2. Print the length of the array to the console using the `length` property.
3. Add two more colors to the array.
4. Print the new length of the array to the console.

## Exercise 4: Joining Arrays

1. Create two arrays: `oddNumbers` with `[1, 3, 5]` and `evenNumbers` with `[2, 4, 6]`.
2. Use the `concat` method to combine these two arrays into a new array called `allNumbers`.
3. Print the `allNumbers` array to the console.

## Exercise 5: Finding the Index of an Element

1. Create an array called `animals` with the values `["cat", "dog", "elephant", "giraffe"]`.
2. Use the `indexOf` method to find the position of "elephant" in the array and print it to the console.
3. Check if "lion" exists in the array using `indexOf` and print the result (`-1` means it doesn't exist).

---

## Exercise 6: Slicing an Array

1. Create an array called `letters` with the values `["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"]`.
2. Use the `slice` method to create a new array called `subset` that contains only the elements from "c" to "e" (inclusive).
3. Print the `subset` array to the console.

---

## Exercise 7: Reversing an Array

1. Create an array called `numbers` with the values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
2. Use the `reverse` method to reverse the order of the elements.
3. Print the reversed array to the console.

---

## Exercise 8: Joining an Array into a String

1. Create an array called `words` with the values `["hello", "world", "JavaScript", "is", "fun"]`.
2. Use the `join` method to combine all the words into a single string, separated by spaces.
3. Print the resulting string to the console.
